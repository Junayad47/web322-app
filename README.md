#Subject Title:
Web Programming Tools and Frameworks

#Subject Description:
The modern world deploys its software applications on the web, because of the web's scale, reach, and ease of use. This course teaches students to design and create simple web applications and services, in JavaScript, using widely-used and powerful tools and frameworks. The major topic themes of this course include a study of the web as a programming platform, server and client programming techniques, an introduction to data storage schemes, and an introduction to security.

#Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

    •  Contrast server-based and web client applications, to make an informed decision about creating a server-based web app.
    
    •  Propose a web app design that is based on a well-organized architecture and design principles, to ensure reliability, quality, enhancement, maintenance, and adaptability.
    
    •  Configure a web app server, using widely-used open source software (including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB), to provide a solution to a business problem or opportunity.
    
    •  Demonstrate professional level scripting skills to implement function closures, callbacks, asynchronous patterns, and to debug an application.
    
    •  Design programmatically-generated web documents, using a view engine, and a CSS framework, to present consistent, accessible and attractively-formatted content.
    
    •  Apply HTTP protocol elements, including messages, URI, clients, GET and POST requests, servers, and responses, to design and implement a modern standards-based web app.
    
    •  Create a simple security system including identity management, authentication, authorization, and resource sharing, to control access to a web app by authorized users.
    
    •  Select a suitable host for a published web app, to enable access on the public web.
    

#Essential Employability Skills:

    •  Execute mathematical operations accurately.

    •  Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
